Canvas LMS Handy Admin Scripts

This is a collection of PHP scripts that use the Canvas LMS API to perform various administrative tasks within Canvas.

Documentation
------
Each script file contains a function that can be added to a library as needed. In addition to the function, there are detailed comments about how to implement the function. There are also few code examples that show how you would call the function from your main script.


Warning
-------
Always test these scripts against your beta or test environment before deploying to production. That should go without saying but... I said it.
